### Introduction

Both variance and entropy are measures of uncertainty.
Variance assumes values vary as points in a space separated by distances.
In this document, the variance of a random vector refers to the
variance of the distance from its mean
(sum of the variances of each component).

Random [one-hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot) vectors are a
convenient spacial representation for categorical random variables.
A [one-hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot) vector has 
all components equal to $0$ except one component that equals $1$.
This representation has been used in genetics [@menozzi_synthetic_1978].
For genetic loci with only two alleles, a one-hot vector has two redundant
components. "Half" of such one-hot vectors are typically used in genetics (e.g.
  [@weir_genetic_1996] p.40,
  [@weir_estimating_2002],
  [@patterson_population_2006]
).
The variance of the "half one-hot vector" is exactly half the variance of its
full one-hot vector.

### Main Result

Given $N$ independent random one-hot vectors $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_N$, define
\begin{eqnarray*}
X_* = X_1 \times X_2 \times \dots \times X_N
\end{eqnarray*}
as the Cartesian product.

The variance of $X_*$ can be adjusted to form a lower bound to the collision
entropy, $\operatorname{H}_2(X_*)$, and Shannon entropy, $\operatorname{H}(X_*)$:
$$
- \lb{\left( 1 - \frac{ \Var{X_*} }{N} \right)}
  \; \le \; \frac{\Htwo{X_*}}{N}
  \; \le \; \frac{\H{X_*}}{N}
$$

If every $X_i$ takes only two equally likely values, then the lower bounds reach equality:
$$
 -\lb{\left( 1 - \frac{ \Var{X_*} }{N} \right)} = \frac{\Htwo{X_*}}{N} = \frac{\H{X_*}}{N} = 1
$$

### Proof

Let $M_i$ be length of $X_i$ (the number of categorical values represented by
$X_i$).  Let $p_{i,j}$ represent the probability of $X_i$ taking the $j$-th
categorical value.

For every $1 \le i \le N$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j} = 1
\end{eqnarray*}

The expectation and variance of the $i$-th one-hot vector $X_i$ is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\E{X_i} & = & \left(\; {p}_{i,1} \;,\; {p}_{i,2} \;,\; \dots \;,\; {p}_{i,M_i} \;\right) \\
\Var{X_i}
  & = & \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j} \left[ (1 - p_{i,j})^2 + \sum_{k \not= j} (0 - p_{i,k})^2 \right] \\
  & = & \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j} \left[ 1 - 2 p_{i,j} + \sum_{k=1}^{M_i} p_{i,k}^2 \right] \\
  & = & 1 - 2 \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j}^2 + \sum_{k=1}^{M_i} p_{i,k}^2  \\
  & = & 1 - \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j}^2
\end{eqnarray*}

Thus the variance of $X_i$ equals the probability of two independent
samples from $X_i$ being distinct. This probability of distinction has been
called logical entropy [@ellerman_logical_2017].

The complement
$$
1 - \Var{X_i} = \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j}^2
$$
is the chance of repetition, which is expected probability. Taking the negative
log gives [Rényi entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9nyi_entropy) of
order 2, also called collision entropy:
$$
-\lb{( 1 - \Var{X_i})}
  = -\lb{\left( \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j}^2 \right)}
  = \operatorname{H}_2(X_i)
$$
Since negative log is a concave function, the negative log of expected
probability (collision entropy), is a lower bound to the expected negative log
of probability (Shannon entropy) by [Jensen's
inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality):
$$
\operatorname{H}_2(X_i)
  = -\lb{\left( \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j}^2 \right)}
  \le \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j} (-\lb{p_{i,j}})
  = \H{X_i}
$$

The total variance, can be adjusted to equal the average probability
of one-hot vector repetition (per one-hot vector):
$$
1 - \frac{ \Var{X_*} }{N}
 = 1 - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \Var{X_i}
 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j}^2
$$

Negative log with [Jensen's
inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality)
can then establish yet another lower bound:
$$
-\lb{\left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j}^2 \right)}
  \le \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( -\lb{\sum_{j=1}^{M_i} p_{i,j}^2} \right)
  = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \operatorname{H}_2(X_i)
$$

Collision and Shannon entropy are additive for independent variables. Putting
everything together we get
$$
-\lb{\left( 1 - \frac{ \Var{X_*} }{N} \right)}
  \; \le \; \frac{\Htwo{X_*}}{N}
  \; \le \; \frac{\H{X_*}}{N}
$$
